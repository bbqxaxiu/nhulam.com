                I write to you, at times from the stained queen-sized mattress we should have thrown out when I left for college, 
                at times from my phone while parked outside the Ross where I quickly learned some toys cost more than half of the tips mom made washing feet that day, 
                and at times from the corner table of a coffee shop where I'll be on high alert because odds are I didn't order anything. 
            </p>
            To every writer, musician, friend, and family member whose words have healed me, moved me, and now inspire mine: thank you.
