                <p>Hey everyone! I was born and raised in Florida, where I spent most of my childhood playing J-RPGs on the PS2, talking a lot for absolutely no reason, watching anime, and listening to hip-hop (this includes both mainstream as well as the 2000s Asian Youtube wave). </p>
                <p>In college, I majored in cmputer science, became invested in civil rights and social activism, and learned to acknowledge my mental health. Since graduating, I've been lending my time and energy to an ed-tech company as a software engineer (and wanna-be comedian).</p>
                <p>To check out what books I've been reading and shows I've been watching lately, check out <a href="https://www.notion.so/6b7cff3fd993442197dbc7fc83ec1271?v=b3ec0c3a8d134a82b9e36caba6bbe174" target="_blank"> this</a> table, which I update regularly.</p>
