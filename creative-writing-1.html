                    Sandwiched between two rings displaying each team’s national flag was the time remaining: 43 minutes. Through the glass panel I catch glimpse of a face exit the elevator and slowly hover over the room, searching for study real estate. The crow and I lock eyes for a split second, but I knew they couldn’t tell I was waiting for us to leave too. All of the common lounges in John Jay (or just JJ, if you messaged it enough) were fashioned the same way: a tv, a table, two—three if you picked the right floor—wooden chairs, a blue couch, and a small kitchenette. Each common lounge a memory of the other and laid out in the exact same pattern, much like ourselves whenever Mexico played. It was Juan and Bryan on the couch, and David, Martin, and I on the chairs (we always picked right).

                    I was aware of every single minute that passed, but the options Thursday nights were this or cleaning up the filthy pile of laundry back in my room. My eyes wandered to the communal microwave, nestled comfortably beneath a tacky cork board plastered with pretend slogans from That Club You Didn’t Have Enough Time For. My leftover đậu hũ and vegetable stir fry needed to be reheated but this Frigidaire, much like the ones on JJ 5, JJ 4, (someone took the one on the third floor), JJ 2, and JJ 1 always made it taste like rubber. Just as the crow gives up, the center-forward scores and the room erupts in a loud uproar—whether out of celebration or disapproval, I couldn’t tell. I ask if Mexico was the one that scored, since it wasn’t clear if the pixel on the screen was wearing green, and resigned myself to the cold carrots.
