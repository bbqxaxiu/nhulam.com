                    <i><a href="https://unsealed-columbia.github.io/" target=”_blank”>UNSEALED</a> is a zine that a friend of mine in college created to showcase Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American writing, art, music, film, and photography. 
                    During my senior year, I took over for him as editor-in-chief and led the publication of the second issue. Throughout the process, I got to look at submissions made by numerous artists both on and off campus (we got submissions from non-students as well). Even though I had always been moved by the power of words, I didn't consider myself an "artistic" person and rarely wrote anything. I did not feel compelled to reflect on any experience in my life. Despite this, I motivated myself to submit something anyways.</i>

                    <i>Many days sitting around waiting for a topic to come to mind and one all nighter later, I finished. When I was done, I learned two important things. First, I learned that writing is something that I do for myself, not for others. I realized that I did not care what anyone thought of my writing. My words were mainly for me: they made me happy, and that alone was enough. Second, I learned that reflecting on experiences in my life—sometimes difficult, if the subject matter is painful—made them feel complete. That an experience cannot be laid to rest until I have reflected on it.</i>
                </p>
                <p><i>So here it is, my submission to the zine: <a href="https://unsealed-columbia.github.io/2019-zine.html" target="_blank">a poem I wrote</a> in memory of my uncle, bác Minh. (See page twenty.) Please excuse the technical errors related to syntax and structure, it was my first time writing a poem and I still have a lot to learn.</i></p>
