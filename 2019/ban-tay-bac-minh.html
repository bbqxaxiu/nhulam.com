                    <i>UNSEALED is a zine that a friend of mine in college created to showcase Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American writing, art, music, film, and photography. 
                    During my senior year, I took over for him as editor-in-chief and led the publication of the second issue. Throughout the process, I got to look at submissions made by numerous artists both on and off campus (we got submissions from non-students as well).</i>

                    <i>I loved it all. It was refreshing seeing things about Southeast Asians or Southeast Asian Americans that was actually made by someone that was Southeast Asian or Southeast Asian American. Even when a submission did not deal with cultural identity directly, it was still nice to see my community represented. I wanted to contribute something too.</i>

                    <i>Many days sitting around waiting for a topic to come to mind and one all nighter later, I finished. For my submission to the zine, I wrote <a href="https://unsealed-columbia.github.io/2019-zine.html" target="_blank">a poem</a> in memory of my uncle, bác Minh. (See page twenty.) Please excuse the technical errors related to syntax and structure, it was my first time writing a poem and I still have a lot to learn.</i>
