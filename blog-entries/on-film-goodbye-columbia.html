                    <i>On March 12th, we received official word from our university president. The WHO had officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic; classes would be online for the rest of the semester, and all students who could leave campus needed to do so immediately. This was one day before the start of Spring Break. At the time, I had invited three friends to spend it with me back in Florida—we had flights set to leave from LaGuardia in less than 24 hours. We looked forward to consistent warm weather; driving across town while singing along to my bluetooth speaker which, starting in high school when I realized its pill shape fit perfectly in the front seat drink holder, I used in place of the aux my ‘05 Accord didn’t have; and fighting over how many orders of Há Cảo we’d get at lunch. All things that so characterized slow suburban life in Florida. </i>

                    <i>In light of the news, we cancelled these plans. I was the only one that made it to Tampa. Over the course of the next week, as I tried to enjoy being home, I found myself frequently visiting my phone for updates from all my social circles, extracurricular or otherwise. It seemed like everyone was anxiously asking the same questions: were those who stayed on campus planning to go home, and were those (like me) who went elsewhere planning to come back? When it came time to make the decision, I chose to return to campus. I reached a compromise with my family: 14 days. 14 days to pack up the rest of my belongings, say goodbye to NYC however I needed to, and wait out the incubation period of the virus before coming back home. </i>

                        The cherry blossom trees in front of Wien Hall. Students look forward to them in late March/early April, as they were a sign that winter (which always seemed to last through 90% of the school year) was finally over. I remember seeing them bloom for the first time as a freshman and wondering how long I could stand and stare without someone noticing me.
