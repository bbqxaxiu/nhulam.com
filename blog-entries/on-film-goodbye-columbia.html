                    <i>On March 12th, we received official word from our university president. The WHO had officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic; classes would be online for the rest of the semester, and all students who could leave campus needed to do so immediately. This was one day before the start of Spring Break. At the time, I had invited three friends to spend it with me back in Florida—we had flights set to leave from LaGuardia in less than 24 hours. We looked forward to consistent warm weather; driving across town while singing along to my bluetooth speaker which, starting in high school when I realized its pill shape fit perfectly in the front seat drink holder, I used in place of the aux my ‘05 Accord didn’t have; and fighting over how many orders of Há Cảo we’d get at lunch. All things that so characterized slow suburban life in Florida. </i>

                    <i>In light of the news, we cancelled these plans. I was the only one that made it to Tampa. Over the course of the next week, as I tried to enjoy being home, I found myself frequently visiting my phone for updates from all my social circles, extracurricular or otherwise. It seemed like everyone was anxiously asking the same questions: were those who stayed on campus planning to go home, and were those (like me) who went elsewhere planning to come back? When it came time to make the decision, I chose to return to campus. I reached a compromise with my family: 14 days. 14 days to pack up the rest of my belongings, say goodbye to NYC however I needed to, and wait out the incubation period of the virus before coming back home. </i>

                        The cherry blossom trees in front of Wien Hall. Students look forward to them in late March/early April, as they were a sign that winter (which always seemed to last through 90% of the school year) was finally over. For seniors, they were also a sign that their last ever round of exams, and furthermore graduation, was approaching. Although I never got to formally enjoy this time period of my senior year, which I expected (among other things) to include photoshoots with friends in our graduation gowns underneath these trees, I hope there will be a second chance in the future.

                        The lawns in front of Butler—undoubtedly my favorite part of campus. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2LyZleBepBM9zK7gwXX34W?si=StDQFcbESPmroRxvd85-6Q">This</a> playlist of mine is inspired by all the time I spent within their rectangular confines, with and without friends, on sunny days.

                        Once, during a Calculus II lecture in the math building (pictured on the left), I was so frustrated at my inability to understand the concepts the professor was explaining that I got up to go to the bathroom and cry. That happened a lot freshmen year with all my classes. Fortunately, it stopped happening during my later years in college, which could be any combination of: my not caring as much anymore, my finally learning the study style that works best for me, and my being more confident in my abilities.

                        Sunlight reaches .05% of all classrooms and hallways in this building. It's always musty, and that's coming from someone who's usually pretty musty herself. Avoid this place at all costs if possible.

                        Always a welcome sight as you emerge from the subway after a long night off campus. Growing up in suburban Florida, where people drive everywhere, I expected the change to New York public transport to be much more difficult. However, I quickly grew fond of spending idle time on the subway listening to music, people watching, and occasionally missing my stop.

                        An aside: while I think I did a relatively good job of exploring the city during my time in college, I'm not completely satisfied. Most of my time I spent in Manhattan, barely going to the other boroughs. I'll do a better job at this next time around.

                        Happy Hot Hunan, a restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue. As far as food-finds go, a relatively late one. It became a staple of my senior year after my friend introduced it to me. Open 'till 1 am (pre-pandemic hours), my friends and I would often come here after a long night of studying to share steamed dumplings and hot tea. (Also, you should get the pumpkin pancakes if you ever go. I'm serious.) I hope they're still around by the time I make it back to New York, but from the looks of it they seem to be doing well despite the new restrictions on restaurants.

                        The flags bordering the freshmen quad. My dorm was the one in the middle. November (or December, I can't recall exactly) of my first semester here, I woke up one morning to an emergency text saying classes were canceled for the day due to the dangerous weather conditions. I peeked outside my window, confused at what was happening. There, falling on this trees in this quad, I saw snow for the first time ever.
