                    <i>Hey everyone, I signed a one year lease for a cozy studio in Chinatown; I'm so happy to finally have my own place. When I was still in school, I only experienced the side of Chinatown that it shows to tourists. I'm hoping to change that during my time here.</i>

                <h3><i>The Making of Asian America</i> by Erika Lee</h3>
                <p>

                    <span class="marginnote"><img src="/../assets/asian-america.jpg"> </span>
                </p>
                <p>This is a non-fiction book about the history of Asians in the Americas. It's told chronologically, starting with the first Asians who came to the Americas by galleon trade (trade between Asia and the Spanish Empire, which crossed through the Americas, from the late 16th century to the early 19th century) and ending with the status of Asians today in the 21st century. </p>
                <p>Lee discusses Asian American history within the context of American history, since the two are inextricably tied. Something interesting that Lee pointed out, which I have never before considered: the status of Asian Americans has (and still is) tied to their country of "origin," often to harmful effect. </p>
                <p>A prime example of this is Japanese Americans during World War II. As Japan led the Pacific theater abroad, Japanese Americans were suspected of espionage and forcibly placed in internment camps. There, they were placed under intense scrutiny and subject to inhumane living conditions. This applied even to Japanese Americans who had been in America for multiple generations. Their unconstitutional detainment is a sad reminder that to be "American" is to be white. It does not matter that you were born in America or that you speak English—at any given moment you can have the title stripped from you, called a spy for a "home" country in which you have never set foot. </p>
                <p>This reminded me a lot of feelings I contended with growing up. In high school, I told my history teacher that I considered myself "American Asian" instead of "Asian American" because I considered myself more American than Asian. In hindsight, this was a naive statement born out of insecurity and the need I felt to prove myself to white people. I no longer feel this way of course, and my understanding of my identity has fortunately also evolved. I no longer see "Asian American" as two separate wholes in which I must choose one over the other. Rather, I see it as a fusion that is entirely distinct from its constituents. A metaphor: I believe in such a thing as "purple" now, instead of just "red and blue." </p>
                <p>Sorry about that, I got side tracked. Either way, if you're Asian American, do yourself a favor and read this book. </p>

                </p>
                <p>This is one of many songs in Saigon Supersound, a compilation from a special period of Vietnamese music ranging from 1965 to 1975 (or the final years of the Vietnam War). The music in this compilation stood out to me because it combines Vietnamese folk with Western pop, something only possible because of America's presence in Vietnam during this historical period. </p>   
                <p>I am used to Vietnamese folk, and the dramatic storytelling concerning motherhood, family, and lost love that characterizes it, since I had to listen to it all the time at home. However, never before have I heard it combined with this subset of instruments; dare I say it, I like this combination sound more than the traditional sound. </p>

                <h3><i>Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)</i> by Kali Uchis</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle">

                </p>
                <p>Kali Uchis graced us with a studio album (almost) completely in Spanish. A few of my favorite songs: fue mejor, vaya con dios, telepatía, and que te pedí. I first got into Kali Uchis in college when a friend recommended her first studio album, Por Vida. I listened to it constantly, much to his (and I'm sure my roommate's) annoyance. "You're ruining that album for me," he told me once. (I'm sorry, lad.) </p>
                <p>What I liked most then, and still like now, is Kali Uchis' attitude and the way she presents herself in her music—she's a cool ass person, and it shows. Never forget, from Por Vida:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"I know I'm some shit. And I'm cool with it."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>  
                <p>(This reads more as a recommendation for Pora Vida than the album I'm recommending now, but I promise they're both good.)</p>
