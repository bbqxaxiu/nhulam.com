                    <i>Hey everyone, I signed a one year lease for a cozy studio in Chinatown; I'm so happy to finally have my own place. When I was still in school, I only experienced the side of Chinatown that it shows to tourists. I'm hoping to change that during my time here.</i>

                </p>
                <p>This is one of many songs in Saigon Supersound, a compilation from a special period of Vietnamese music ranging from 1965 to 1975—the final years of the Vietnam War. The music in this compilation stood out to me because it combines Vietnamese folk with Western pop, something only possible because of American presence in Vietnam during this time.</p>   
                <p>I am used to Vietnamese folk and the dramatic storytelling concerning motherhood, family, and lost love that characterizes it since I had to listen to it all the time at home. Bác Minh and Nine would play it on Sundays, the only day of the week they worked fewer hours, while they made their morning cà phê sữa đá. I remember complaining that it was loud and asking them to turn it down. I felt then, and still do now, that the whole genre is sad. That it seems the only thing Vietnamese people can sing or talk about is what pains them.  </p>
                <p>But this song doesn't make me feel that way. Although the lyrics are still melodramatic (the title translates to "Mama's Girl," so you can imagine the kind of painful shit she talks about), the inclusion of Western instruments gives it a lighter tone. I think I like this combination sound more than the traditional sound, it feels more balanced and consumable. </p>

                <h3><i>The Making of Asian America</i> by Erika Lee</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><img src="/../assets/asian-america.jpg"> </span>
                </p>
                <p>This is a non-fiction book about the history of Asians in the Americas. It's told chronologically, starting with the first Asians who came to the Americas by galleon trade (trade between Asia and the Spanish Empire, which crossed through the Americas, from the late 16th century to the early 19th century) and ending with the status of Asians today in the 21st century. </p>
                <p>Lee discusses Asian American history within the context of American history, since the two are inextricably tied, and points out a lot of stuff that many of us don't think twice about anymore. First, how the status of Asian Americans has often been tied to their country of "origin." (In World War II, Japanese Americans were detained in internment camps under suspicion of being spies for Japan.) Second, how white people have always been creative in getting people of color to fight amongst one another. (The model minority myth.) </p>
                <p>Asides from these refreshers, I enjoyed the fact that Lee touched on the history of a large number of Asian groups including Chinese American, Phillipino American, Indian American, Japanese American, Vietnamese American, Laos American, and Hmong American. I took a few classes in college on both ancient and modern Vietnamese history, so I knew a good amount of the section on Vietnamese Americans already, but it was nice to learn about the other groups as well. The inclusion of Laos American and Hmong American history was especially appreciated, since I feel these two groups rarely get representation.</p>
                <p>Last of all, I enjoyed this book because I feel like the more I learn about Asian American history, the more the invisible curtain separating my mom's generation from my own is torn down. Since they never talk about themselves, this is one of the few ways I can understand the circumstances that have shaped their lives. If you also are Asian American, there's a good chance you may feel this way too. Do yourself a favor and read this book.</p>

                <h3><i>Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)</i> by Kali Uchis</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/00wSTrFxoSzA7eeS1UxHgd" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></span>
                </p>
                <p>Kali Uchis graced us with a studio album (almost) completely in Spanish. A few of my favorite songs: fue mejor, vaya con dios, telepatía, and que te pedí.</p>
                <p>I first got into Kali Uchis in college when a friend recommended her first studio album, Por Vida. I listened to it constantly, much to his (and I'm sure my roommate's) annoyance. "You're ruining that album for me," he told me once. (I'm sorry, lad.) Anyways, a line in Por Vida:</p>
                <p>
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"I know I'm some shit. And I'm cool with it."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>  
                <p>I can't tell you how refreshing it was to hear this come out of a woman's mouth. There's more pressure on women than men to be kind and thoughtful, and people accept when men are pieces of shit ("oh, that's just him being a boy") but berate women for the same thing ("she's being a bitch"). There have been times in my life where I've done the same shitty thing a man has done, but I was the only one that faced social backlash. Times where I was made to feel guilty for saying no, treating a boy the same way he treated me, or not giving my time and energy to someone.  </p>
                <p>However, as I'm now noticing, women like her are starting to give less of a fuck about catering to this double standard. Why we gotta say yes all the time? Why we gotta be nice to someone who was mean to us? Why we gotta feel like we owe others our time and energy? Seems like an obvious fact, but women are people too. And that means some of us are nice and some of us aren't. It means some of us like doing stuff for others and some of us don't. (I'm cringing at the fact that I have to say these things to prove our humanity.) Either way, I'm glad Kali Uchis feels empowered to be who she is. She's a piece of shit...so what?</p>
                <p>(This reads more as a recommendation for Pora Vida than the album I'm recommending now, but I promise they're both good.)</p>
