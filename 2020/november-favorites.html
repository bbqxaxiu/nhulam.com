                    <i>Hey everyone, I signed a one year lease for a cozy studio in Chinatown; I'm so happy to finally have my own place. When I was still in school, I only experienced the side of Chinatown that it shows to tourists. I'm hoping to change that during my time here.</i>

                <p>This is one of many songs in Saigon Supersound, a compilation from a special period of Vietnamese music ranging from 1965 to 1975—the final years of the Vietnam War. The music in this compilation stood out to me because it combines Vietnamese folk with Western pop, something only possible because of American presence in Vietnam during this time.</p>   
                <p>I am used to Vietnamese folk and the dramatic storytelling concerning motherhood, family, and lost love that characterizes it since I had to listen to it all the time at home. Bác Minh and Nine would play it on Sundays, the only day of the week they worked fewer hours, while they made their morning cà phê sữa đá. I remember complaining that it was loud and asking them to turn it down. I felt then, and still do now, that the whole genre is sad. That it seems the only thing Vietnamese people can sing or talk about is what pains them.  </p>
                <p>But this song doesn't make me feel that way. Although the lyrics are still melodramatic (the title translates to "Mama's Girl," so you can imagine the kind of painful shit she talks about), the inclusion of Western instruments gives it a lighter tone. I think I like this combination sound more than the traditional sound, it feels more balanced and consumable. </p>

                <h3><i>The Making of Asian America</i> by Erika Lee</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><img src="/../assets/asian-america.jpg"> </span>
                </p>
                <p>This is a non-fiction book about the history of Asians in the Americas. It's told chronologically, starting with the first Asians who came to the Americas by galleon trade (trade between Asia and the Spanish Empire, which crossed through the Americas, from the late 16th century to the early 19th century) and ending with the status of Asians today in the 21st century. </p>
                <p>Lee discusses Asian American history within the context of American history, since the two are inextricably tied, and points out a lot of stuff that many of us don't think twice about anymore. First, how the status of Asian Americans has often been tied to their country of "origin." (In World War II, Japanese Americans were detained in internment camps under suspicion of being spies for Japan.) Second, how white people have always been creative in getting people of color to fight amongst one another. (The model minority myth.) </p>
                <p>Asides from these refreshers, I enjoyed the fact that Lee touched on the history of a large number of Asian groups including Chinese American, Phillipino American, Indian American, Japanese American, Vietnamese American, Laos American, and Hmong American. I took a few classes in college on both ancient and modern Vietnamese history, so I knew a good amount of the section on Vietnamese Americans already, but it was nice to learn about the other groups as well. The inclusion of Laos American and Hmong American history was especially appreciated, since I feel these two groups rarely get representation.</p>
                <p>Last of all, I enjoyed this book because I feel like the more I learn about Asian American history, the more the invisible curtain separating my mom's generation from my own is torn down. Since they never talk about themselves, this is one of the few ways I can understand the circumstances that have shaped their lives. If you also are Asian American, there's a good chance you may feel this way too. Do yourself a favor and read this book.</p>
