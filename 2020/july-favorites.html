                    <i>Work starts soon in early August, so I've been taking advantage of this time to immerse myself in all the books, TV, and music I didn't have enough time for in college. Here are some of my favorites from this month.</i>

                <h3><i>Pachinko</i> by Min Jin lee</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><img src="/../assets/pachinko.jpg"> </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this book, Lee sets out on the arduous task of telling a story spanning multiple generations and families. Each chapter is a time skip from the last and focuses on a different character. (And depending on the character, the location may change too.) Lee interwove every character's life together so well that, despite each time skip and each change in focus to a different character, I never felt that I was reading multiple stories.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to this, despite the large ensemble of characters that drive this story, Lee was able to make you like each one. Her characters were relatable and felt like they could be real people in your life; she never fell into the trap of making a character too good or virtuous. Because of this, I found myself invested in each and every one. (I don't have favorites, but if I had to choose, it'd be Yumi.)</p>
                <p>Last, the historical context is particularly compelling. This book takes place during the height of Japanese imperialism and World War II. Lee explores Korean-Japanese relations and the treatment of Koreans as second-class citizens in Japan, something that every character—Korean or otherwise—must navigate. I learned that many discriminatory practices and methods of cultural assimilation were levied upon Koreans living in Japan. (Before reading this book, I must admit that I only knew about the atrocities committed by Japan against China during this time period, but nothing on Korea.) One practice that particularly stung to read involves the compulsory surrender of surnames—every Korean had to replace theirs with a Japanese one. </p>
                <p>It's a long book, and I enjoyed every moment of reading it. So much in fact that I went out to purchase my own copy. I heavily recommend that you give it a chance. </p>

                <h3><i>My Own Words</i> by Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><img src="/../assets/rbg.jpg"> </span>
                </p>
                <p>I am still only in the middle of this book, but I have only good things to say so far. This book is a collection of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's writings, organized chronologically from her days as an editor for her high school newspaper through her days as a Justice on our country's highest court. She has incredible command over her writing, able to articulate her thoughts concisely, never wasting a word (and thus your time or mine), and clearly, never using jargon that turns off the less-read reader. I want to quote someone that she herself quoted:</p>
                <p>
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"As women achieve power, the barriers will fall. As society sees what women can do, as women see what women can do, there will be more women out there doing things, and we'll all be better off for it."</p>

                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>I have thought about what my "next steps" are after graduating, since software engineering does not bring me fulfillment. These words make me wonder if law school could be my next step. I have always understood that, as a minority, I represent more than myself in all endeavors. Will achieving power and becoming a representation for what women can do bring me fulfillment? Pause on this though, since this might just be the side of myself that likes catering to my ego talking. I'll mull it over a little more. </p>

                <h3><i>Garden (Say It Like Dat)</i> by SZA</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle">

                </p>
                <p>During the fall semester of my senior year, a close friend showed me a few of SZA's lesser known songs. This was one of them. I'm glad I gave my full attention to the songs he sent, because SZA has now become one of my favorite artists. Her voice sounds nice, but what I find most impressive is her lyricism. I believe that SZA really understands and knows herself, and that is why she is able to write what she does. </p>

                                <p>Cause you'll never love me</p>
                                <p>You'll never love me, you'll never love me</p>

                                <p>Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?</p>
                                <p>Oh, I believe you when you say it like that</p>

                <p>Like most songs I listen to, this talks about insecurity. The narrator cannot reconcile with the parts of herself that she feels make her unworthy of someone else's love. She hides them away, believing that because she can't love herself in spite of them, someone else won't either. She goes on this way until she is interrupted by someone that comes along. This person loves her so deeply that it confuses her initially ("Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?"), but they persist, and she finally accepts their love ("Oh [....] you must really love me..."). This moment is incredibly important. In accepting this person's love, she is also accepting what that must mean: for all that she is, she is still lovable. </p>
                <p>And that leads me to my next point: this song is not just talking about insecurity, it is talking about self-love too. The two go hand in hand, since reconciling with our insecurities is the first, the single, hurdle we must overcome to learn self-love. But this is admittedly difficult, and sometimes we need a little push from someone else. We are hearing a story of how this did happen. Whoever the narrator is speaking to, be they a friend or significant other, accepts who she is and loves her. And though we do not explicitly get to hear it at the end of the song, I'm willing to bet she decides she will do the same.</p>

                    Quick life update:  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've started the paperwork to legally change my surname from Đoàn to Lâm, my mother's. Đoàn no longer reflects how I see myself. Thanks, mama, for raising me on your own—today and everyday, I celebrate you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last, I've settled into my condo in Gainesville, where I have my own room and bathroom (definitely an upgrade from sleeping in my aunt's room back home). I have six roommates, two of whom are cats. The cats fortunately haven't caused any serious allergic reaction for me yet. There is an East Asian grocery store walking distance from my place, which I plan to patronize frequently. (Edit 8/02/20: I take this back, their pork ribs are overpriced...you can't be selling them for more than $5 per lb.)  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I haven't been here long enough to say for sure whether or not I like it, but I predict I will.
