                    <i>Work starts soon in early August, so I've been taking advantage of this time to immerse myself in all the books and music I didn't have enough time for in college. Here are some of my favorites from this month.</i>

                <h3><i>Pachinko</i> by Min Jin lee</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><img src="/../assets/pachinko.jpg"> </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this book, Lee sets out on the arduous task of telling a story spanning multiple generations and families. Each chapter is a time skip from the last and focuses on a different character. (And depending on the character, the location may change too.) Lee interwove every character's life together so well that, despite each time skip and each change in focus to a different character, I never felt that I was reading multiple stories.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to this, despite the large ensemble of characters that drive this story, Lee was able to make you like each one. Her characters were relatable and felt like they could be real people in your life; she never fell into the trap of making a character too good or virtuous. Because of this, I found myself invested in each and every one. (I don't have favorites, but if I had to choose, it'd be Yumi.)</p>
                <p>The historical context is also interesting. This book takes place during the height of Japanese imperialism and World War II. Lee explores Korean-Japanese relations and the treatment of Koreans as second-class citizens in Japan, something that every character—Korean or otherwise—must navigate. I learned that many discriminatory practices and methods of cultural assimilation were levied upon Koreans living in Japan. (Before reading this book, I only knew about the atrocities committed against China during this time period.) </p>
                <p>It's a long book (over 500 pages if I remember correctly), and I enjoyed every moment of reading it. So much so that I went out to purchase my own copy. I heavily recommend that you give it a chance.</p>

                <h3><i>My Own Words</i> by Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><img src="/../assets/rbg.jpg"> </span>
                </p>
                <p>This book is a collection of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's writings, organized chronologically from her days as an editor for her high school newspaper. I love the way she writes: terse, yet comprehensive. She is a great example of someone who understands the power of words. One of my favorite phrases in the book:</p>
                <p>
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Gloria's bright mind, brave heart, and unflagging energy inspired that venture and so much else that, borrowing words from her friend Marlo Thomas, freed girls and boys to be you and me."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>    
                <p>(I forget who Gloria is and what she did...) I have thought about what my "next steps" are after graduating, since software engineering does not bring me fulfillment. I wonder if law school could be my next step. Pause on this though, since this might just be the side of myself that likes catering to my ego talking. I'll mull it over a little more.</p>

                <h3><i>Garden (Say It Like Dat)</i> by SZA</h3>
                <p>
                    <label for="4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853</label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle">
                    <span class="marginnote"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/19woxaSpjOefa2JnAOoqW5" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></span>
                </p>
                <p>During the fall semester of my senior year, a close friend showed me a few of SZA's lesser known songs. This was one of them. I'm glad I gave my full attention to the songs he sent, because SZA has now become one of my favorite artists. Her voice sounds nice, but what I find most impressive is her lyricism. I believe that SZA really understands and knows herself, and that is why she is able to write what she does. A snippet:</p>
                <p>
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <p>And hope you never find out who I really am</p>
                                <p>Cause you'll never love me</p>
                                <p>You'll never love me, you'll never love me</p>
                                <p>But I believe you when you say it like that</p>
                                <p>Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?</p>
                                <p>Oh, I believe you when you say it like that</p>
                                <p>You must really love me...</p>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>Like most songs I listen to, this talks about insecurity. The narrator cannot reconcile with the parts of herself that she feels make her unworthy of someone else's love. She hides them away, believing that because she can't love herself in spite of them, someone else won't either. She goes on this way until she is interrupted by someone that comes along. This person loves her so deeply that it confuses her initially ("Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?"), but they persist, and she finally accepts their love ("Oh [....] you must really love me..."). This moment is incredibly important. In accepting this person's love, she is also accepting what that must mean: for all that she is, she is still lovable. </p>
                <p>And that leads me to my next point: this song is not just talking about insecurity, it is talking about self-love too. The two go hand in hand, since reconciling with our insecurities is the first, the single, hurdle we must overcome to learn self-love. But this is admittedly difficult, and sometimes we need a little push from someone else. We are hearing a story of how this did happen. Whoever the narrator is speaking to, be they a friend or significant other, accepts who she is and loves her. And though we do not explicitly get to hear it at the end of the song, I'm willing to bet she decides she will do the same.</p>
