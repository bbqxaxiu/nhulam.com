                        If your cousin has kids, what is their relation to you/what do they call you? No idea, so for now, I'll just make them call me Auntie. The one on the right takes after our side of the family more, which is probably why she's cuter. Jk they're both cute.

                        The Howard Franklin is really cute when it wants to be. When Ma used to commute across the bridge every day, I was scared she was going to get into an accident and fall into the water. Good thing she retired now sis!

                        Taken on the University of Florida's campus. The skies in Gainesville are pretty...it's starting to get way too humid here for me though. I had forgotten what it was like to be in Florida during the summer, since for the last four years I was always away interning.

                        The donut holes are better than the donuts. Also, the donut with the raspberry filling wasn't as good as I thought it would be; I really believe people should stop mixing fruit with baked desserts.
