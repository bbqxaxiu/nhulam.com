                    <i>The title of this entry is a play on Frank Ocean’s song, “Songs for Women.” I was obsessed with him in middle school: back then, I illegally downloaded songs from The Lonny Breaux Collection (never officially released, but some select songs are on MixtapeMonkey or Youtube) and listened to them during my “free” period as a library assistant. Of that collection, I highly recommend "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW0-Da4KADg&list=PLJBhRlWKrT_MIZAf7S_tmI8O82rTvRE0G&index=1">Miss You So</a>." Along with the artists of the theme songs for Inuyasha, he was all I listened to. But I digress.</i>

                    Growing up, I had a significant amount of internalized misogyny. This took the form of slut-shaming, equating a woman's appearance with her worth, and looking down on being “too girly” (e.g. wearing pink, frills, or dresses). This internalized misogyny manifested itself in not only how I treated other women, but myself too. At the time, it felt like men dictated how anyone should talk about women, and this includes how women should talk about women. In 7th grade, for example, I remember my circle of girlfriends and I constantly pointing out girls who looked bad when they weren’t wearing makeup—boiling everything they were down to just their appearances, just as the men around us did.

                    Fast forward ten years or so, and I have largely grown out of my internalized misogyny. It happened sometime during college and was largely inspired by my exposure to progressive ideology, namely patriarchy as a crooked construct. It felt like most things “clicked” for me when I gained this exposure, and it helped explain many aspects of our society that plagued me but that I did not have the language to express or ability to understand. By this I of course mean misogyny, but it also includes other aspects of our society such as cultural appropriation, the under-representation of LGBTQ+ communities, racial gaps in educational (and thus financial) attainment, and more.

                    While I cannot offer a single fix-all solution to this issue that plagued me as a young girl, I offer a small remedy, based on music, that may be one starting point of many. Few things speak to me as easily as music does, so that is why I have chosen it for this venture. Here I have compiled a list of songs that share a theme of empowerment. Some artists, like Raveena, deliver on this theme through an internal back-and-forth where she reflects on the sacrifices women make both in motherhood and in (heterosexual) marriage:
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“Mama, who were you before your man? Know you had some of those bigger plans.”</p>
                            <footer>Raveena, <cite>Mama</cite></footer>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But empowerment need not look like explicitly discussing what is specific to women: motherhood, being a wife, not being a man. When we refuse to define ourselves as simply the "opposite of man," we free ourselves from the shackles of gender, and that in and of itself is  empowerment. I really like Ari Lennox for this very reason. The main goal of her music is to be an outlet for discussing her life, not proving herself to the other. Like in this next song where she talks about overcoming her struggle with anxiety, which she compares to the white noise (static) of radio/tv: 
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“You're in control love. Don't let the static drown us. You're in control love. How good you are, I know love, I know love.”</p>
                            <footer>Ari Lennox, <cite>Static</cite></footer>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Female voices such as these are vastly under-represented in our society, and I believe the more people are exposed to them, the more they will rethink their attitudes towards women. Now, you may have noticed I have chosen to single men out (“Songs for Men”), despite the fact that both men and women can benefit from this increased exposure. This is because internalized misogyny cannot exist where misogyny does not first exist, and misogyny is inherently a male creation. This requires that men are called out and pushed to educate themselves first and foremost. To the man reading this, I am not blaming you for growing up in a society where these voices are not seen as important. Most men are perpetuating this system of injustice unconsciously, in the same way that most women, including myself in middle school, are. But let this be a small start.
