                    <i>I'm trying to write more flash fiction because they're easy to commit to. I wrote this piece snuggled up next to my window, listening to <a target=”_blank” href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7gbS4o4vxZmJatf8sFB8N3?si=tRIX9U3WRWiEbcR-4YGW_A">this</a> song on repeat (it's so beautiful, please go listen to it), and watching the snow melt off the window of my neighbor's apartment. I hope you enjoy!</i>

                    Vyna liked a lot of things about being at school. She liked the way her teacher skewed their classroom library in favor of non-fiction over fiction. During quiet reading time, Vyna liked learning about Harriet Tubman's life and how cities in ancient Egypt were designed. Vyna tended to stay away from any of the fiction, and particularly the fantasy or sci-fi, because she felt they were just lesser versions of the manga she had back home.

                    This didn't mean she thought poorly of Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, or any of that lot, however; from on what Vyna pieced together from overheard conversations, their stories and characters seemed interesting. Nevertheless, Vyna believed that if you must read about an academy whose students had magical abilities, one whose students saved the adults instead of the other way around, then you were better off reading Soul Eater instead.                 </p>

                    She also liked that after quiet reading time, when it was time to head to lunch, she was the designated line-leader. Being a line-leader was easy work, all she needed to do was read out the order of names that her teacher had arranged on a clipboard. Her teacher, Ms. Rogers, randomized the order every week so that no one stayed in the same position in line and would be stuck with the same neighbors. 
                <p>
                    The exception to this was the line-leader and the caboose, who stayed in the same spot for the whole year. Ms. Rogers filled these two positions at the beginning of the year based on recommendations from previous teachers. Line-leader and caboose politics weren't complicated, and Vyna figured the system out quickly: you needed to be a teacher's pet and/or be at the top of your class. Vyna was both, and was determined to make the most of her 1 year term. She read out the order on the clipboard quickly, omitting surnames, and watched as her classmates lined up. When she was done, Vyna and the caboose assumed their positions in line and the lot headed out the door.

                    Their cafeteria was small, but the tables were packed tightly together enough that all of the 4th grade could eat together at the same time. Most of her classmates sat at the tables closest to the food line, since it was closest to the television (unfortunately, also closest to the trashcans). Vyna preferred the tables two rows over, where it was quieter, less smelly and, as a bonus, also had a clear view of the clock on the wall. When 30 minutes had passed, Vyna would know it was time to to call her classmates to line up once more.

                    But what Vyna liked most about school was the feeling she'd get just as she was about to leave it. During reading time, Vyna's mind was focused on the disguises Harriet Tubman used to avoid detection and the way cities in ancient Egypt struggled to separate sewage water from drinking water. During lunch, Vyna's mind was focused on choosing the most strategic seat in the cafeteria. But when the school day was over, and Ms. Rogers escorted the class (line-leaders and cabooses were off duty after lunch) to the pick-up area, Vyna's mind was only focused on seeing her mom again.

                    Vyna was always patient as she watched car after car turn into the parking lot, slow down, and pick up their kids. Vyna liked the feeling of anticipation she'd get as she waited to see her mom's '04 Toyota. She liked that it was always gratified, because her mom was never late and never delegated the task to any of Vyna's aunties. This was a ritual the two of them alone shared; a slow-down to a halt, mutual eye contact, and a wave of recognition was all that separated them from being together after a long school day. When Vyna got into the car, she hugged her mom, listened to her gossip about her coworkers to her sisters, and looked forward to going back to school again tomorrow.
