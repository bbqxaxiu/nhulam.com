                    <i>I've moved to Gainesville! (Home is just a 2 hour drive away, and I come back every three weeks or so.) My roommates are a girl I knew in high school, her boyfriend, and another couple. I think living with people who you aren't that close with is really good for you, because you can still feel like you're on your own. Also, I have my own bathroom here, which I've only ever had in London when I was abroad...I feel like I can never go back to sharing a bathroom again.</i>

                        Taken during a weekend I spent back home. In the background are the apartments and condos lining the strip of beaches in my hometown. The strip of beaches is connected to the mainland by a handful of bridges: the Belleair Causeway, Indian Rocks Causeway, and Tom Stuart Causeway. In between is the intercostal, where you get views like this.

                        When I saw this bird, I thought about Elizabeth Bishop's poem, <i>Florida</i>, which we had to read in high school. It talked about the natural wildlife and fauna of what Bishop calls "the state with the prettiest name." I'd have to agree.                     </span>

                        I took a solo one-day road trip to the towns on the outskirts of Gainesville, and found this pretty field. This scenery reminds me a lot of the town that Friday Night Lights (probably my favorite white American show of all time) takes place in. I think living in a small town would be really nice. I could get a P.O. box so that no one knows where I live and just enjoy the quiet.

                        I'm going to return to this bench when the weather is sunny and I have a good book. Recently I've been reading <i>The Book of Salt</i> by Monique Truong, and I like it a lot. It's a story about a man who left behind his life in Sài Gòn and now lives as a cook in Paris. The author often jumps back and forth between different points of time in the narrative, and even though it's a lot to follow sometimes (not because she's not good at it, but because that kind of storytelling demands your full attention), it always helps strengthen some emotional arc, interpersonal relationship, or reveal.
