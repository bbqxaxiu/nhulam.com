                    <i>I've avoided writing stories that focus on multiple characters, because dialogue (at least dialogue that sounds realistic) is hard. Realistic characters are also hard. I think both require a lot of empathy, and unfortunately, I am only used to how I see the world. Regardless...I'm trying now!</i>

                    From where she sat, Thùy had a view of the tall boy in front of her and not much else. Stephanie had meant well by getting her center orchestra seats, but failed to take into account that Thùy may have fared better in the mezzanine, where she would have an angled view to compensate for the fact that she was 5'2". Why the pitch of the theater began only after the most expensive section, Thùy wondered but had no motivation to ask. The reason was bound to be obscure to everyone except those who frequented music venues with a dress code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was partly her own fault, since Stephanie had called the weekend beforehand to ask if there were any seating preferences. Each person in her a capella group received a number of tickets to give to friends and family for their concert, and she wanted to invite Thùy. At the time, however, Thùy was in the library, simultaneously preparing for her physics midterm and combing Reddit; only the remaining 30% of her mental capacity was allocated to their phone call. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hey Thùy, when are you coming in to Boston next Saturday? It starts at 4:30. Did you decide if you were going to fly or not?" Stephanie had at least 90% going. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No I don't think I'll fly, I'm looking into other options right now. I-" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If you don't fly, you're looking at 1.5 hours on the train from Princeton to New York, then about 4 hours on the bus from New York to Boston. 5.5 hours total. You okay with that? Also what section do you want to sit in?" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It'll be fine. I'll book the tickets right after this. Also hey, did you know snowflakes reflect light? I'm reading that on this thread." 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What? No I didn't. How did you stumble on that? By the way, once you get to New York I think the buses leaving from Chinatown will be cheaper. Check the prices for those first? See you next weekend. I'm late for rehearsal now. Bye. Don't forget to text me where you wanna sit."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thùy hung up and went back to Reddit. Collegiate a cappella wasn't her scene, but it was still was an opportunity to simultaneously support her friend and get out of Princeton for a weekend. The travel there would also be pleasant, and Thùy looked forward to idling on public transit. In those 5 or so hours, she would lounge, use their minute details to make up stories about her fellow passengers, and drown out their voices with the same two songs. Thùy set aside a tab on Megabus' website as a mental reminder to buy the tickets, and, already forgetting Stephanie's request, continued scrolling through /r/todayilearned.

                    "This could have been avoided," Thùy thought as she started slouching in her seat. She started counting the freckles on the nape of her neighbor's neck—aside from her own two feet, it would be her only view for the evening. There was solace in the fact that the performances would be over in two hours. This was an estimate, one based partly on the list of student groups performing and partly on what Thùy thought was an acceptable amount of time to ask for an audience's attention. Or, in her case, an acceptable amount of time to ask someone to count freckles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Thùy was slowly coming to terms with the neighbor in front of her, other neighbors joined. On her right, a family of four squeezed into the same row. The mom—pale, slender, and the type to make small talk—slid in first, followed by her two sons, both of who who looked no older than nine. The two boys wore neatly ironed crimson sweaters over cotton button-downs, no doubt at her behest—kids don't dress like that of their own accord. Closing off the row was her husband who, contrary to the school spirit beaming from his HARVARD DAD hat, looked like he was also looking forward to leaving. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Isn't this exciting? My daughter's in one of the groups, she's a senior now." It was the mom, confirming Thùy's suspicions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yeah, it is." Thùy corrected her posture. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Do you have a friend performing? What group are they in?" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I do. My friend's group is...um..." Thùy rummaged through the program again, searching for her friend's name. There, on page two:
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Stephanie Wang (Alto), Class of 2018</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Here's my friend, it says she's in the Opportunes."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That's not the one Jenny's in. Jenny's in the Radcliffe Pitches, the oldest all-female group." Jenny, her oldest, had made her proud by getting into her parents' alma mater. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, cool." Thùy knew it was a calculated decision whenever parents used names instead of just saying "my daughter" or "my son" when bragging to strangers. Not only are these kinds of parents proud, but they are also overly eager and invested in their children's lives: the added layer of being parents to Ivy League offspring only exacerbated this. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking for an exit from the conversation, Thùy pretended to kneel over to fix her shoe laces. To some, parents like these were proud, but to Thùy, they were performative. Thùy started untying the already perfect knots on her Chuck Taylors. And not only were they performative, but their kids were too. Thùy brought the left and right strands of her shoe laces together, making sure they were level. These kids were bound to drag the show out, needing to milk as much time in the spotlight as possible. Thùy crossed the two strands and looped the right strand under the X, retying the original knot. When finished, she sat up and went back to slouching—she'd need to be comfortable for the evening ahead.
