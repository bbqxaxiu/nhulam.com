                    <i>I've avoided writing stories that focus on multiple characters, because dialogue (at least dialogue that sounds realistic) is hard. Realistic characters are also hard. I think both require a lot of empathy, and unfortunately, I am only used to how I see the world. Regardless...I'm trying now!</i>

                    From where she sat, Thùy had a view of the tall boy in front of her and not much else. Stephanie had meant well by getting her center orchestra seats, but failed to take into account that Thùy may have fared better in the mezzanine, where she would have an angled view to compensate for the fact that she was 5'2". Why the pitch of the theater began only after the most expensive section, Thùy wondered but had no motivation to ask—the reason was bound to be obscure to everyone except those who willingly frequented music venues with a dress code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was partly her own fault, since Stephanie had called the weekend beforehand to ask if there were any seating preferences. Each person in her a capella group received a number of tickets to give to friends and family for their concert, and she wanted to invite Thùy. At the time, however, Thùy was in the library, simultaneously preparing for her physics midterm and combing Reddit; only the remaining 30% of her mental capacity was allocated to their phone call. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No I don't think I'll fly, I'm looking into other options right now. I-" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If you don't fly, you're looking at 1.5 hours on the train from Princeton to New York, then about 4 hours on the bus from New York to Boston. 5.5 hours total. You okay with that?" Stephanie had at least 90% going. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I like public transit, so it'll be nice. I'll book the tickets right after this. Also hey, did you know snowflakes reflect light? I'm reading that on Reddit." 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What? No I didn't. How did you stumble on that? By the way, once you get to New York I think the buses leaving from Chinatown will be cheaper. Check the prices for those first? See you next weekend. I'm leaving for rehearsal now. Bye."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thùy hung up and went back to Reddit, needing more answers. She was skeptical that she would like collegiate a capella, but it was still was an opportunity to simultaneously support her friend and get out of Princeton for a weekend. Moreover, she was looking forward to traveling in the peace of public transit. She loved making out figures in the blur of passing them by; loved making up stories about her fellow passengers using minute details, like how far they lean their chair back into the next row, how much of the armrest they're willing to share, or how they arrange their bodies while preparing to doze off; and, most of all, loved how her music sounded better when used to eclipse them. Thùy set aside a tab on Megabus' website, a mental note for the bus tickets she'd need to book for her travel, and, returning to her first tab, continued scrolling through /r/todayilearned.

                    "Well, I didn't pay for this," Thùy thought as she resigned herself to her seat. There was solace in the fact that the performances would be over in two hours. But this of course was just an estimate, one based partly on the list of student groups performing in the program and partly on what Thùy thought was an acceptable amount of time to make people sit in semi-formal attire. On her right, a family of four squeezed into the row. The mom—pale, slender, and the type to make small talk—slid in first, followed by her two sons, both of whom looked no older than eight. Closing off the row was her husband who, contrary to the school spirit beaming from his HARVARD DAD hat, looked like he was also looking forward to leaving.

                    "Isn't this exciting? My daughter's in one of the groups, she's a senior now." It was the mom, confirming Thùy's suspicions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yeah, it is." Thùy corrected her posture. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Do you have a friend performing? What group are they in?" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I do. My friend's group is...um..." Thùy rummaged through the program again, searching for her friend's name. There, on page two:
                    <div class="epigraph">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Stephanie Wang (Alto), Class of 2018</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Here's my friend, it says she's in the Opportunes."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That's not the one Jenny's in. Jenny's in the Radcliffe Pitches, the oldest all-female group." Jenny, her oldest, had made her proud by getting into her parents' alma mater. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, cool." Thùy knew it was a calculated decision whenever parents used names instead of just saying "my daughter" or "my son" when bragging to strangers. Not only are these kinds of parents proud, but they are also overly eager and invested in their children's lives; the added layer of being parents to Ivy League offspring only exacerbated this. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thùy went back to slouching, needing to get comfortable for the evening ahead.
